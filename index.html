<p>Hello! I am Joshua Muscat (s3661072) and I'm in the first year of my Bachelor of IT at RMIT University. I've been at RMIT
for two and a half years already studying electrical engineering. I completed my Advanced Diploma of Engineering - Electrical
Technology in 2018 and dropped out of the Bachelor of Electrical Engineering in 2019. I was born in Australia and lived here
my whole life. My nationality is half Italian and half Maltese. I am a huge wrestling fan and recently bought a lot of the old
WWE games starting from the year 2000. I love going back and playing these older games because it gives you a snapshot of what
WWE was like at the time. I also have a Maltese Shih Tzu named Lily that is very hyperactive and needy for a dog.</p>

<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
<p>I've always been a fan of computers, games and technology. As far back as I can remember I've had a computer in the house and
have always used it. I decided to study IT when I was not enjoying electrical engineering. I didn't want to drop out completely
and was trying to figure out what field I was going to move into. I was going to become an electrician since I already had the
electrical background but then my cousin suggested I try IT and here we are today.</p>

<p>The reason I chose to study at RMIT is because initially when I was doing electrical engineering it was one of the best places
to study it in Melbourne. So once I had decided to transfer into IT i thought I'd continue doing it at RMIT since I was already
familiar with the city campus. I also really like the program structure of the Bachelor of IT at RMIT and have multiple friends
that recommended the program to me.</p>

<p>Through the Bachelor of IT at RMIT I hope to learn the skills required to find a job in a field of IT I enjoy. I am hoping
to learn the various programming languages that will help me with various things like web and app development. I also would
like to learn various design principles that would help create and design websites and mobile applications in the future. </p>

<h2> My Ideal Job </h2>
<p>My ideal job would be around the fields of either web or application development. I wouldn't mind either having a 5 day a week
job at a place or doing freelance work and being able to use flexible hours to travel.</p>
