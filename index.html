<h1>My profile this that</h1>
<p>Hello! I am Joshua Muscat (s3661072) and I'm in the first year of my Bachelor of IT at RMIT University. I've been at RMIT
for two and a half years already studying electrical engineering. I completed my Advanced Diploma of Engineering - Electrical
Technology in 2018 and dropped out of the Bachelor of Electrical Engineering in 2019. I was born in Australia and lived here
my whole life. My nationality is half Italian and half Maltese. I am a huge wrestling fan and recently bought a lot of the old
WWE games starting from the year 2000. I love going back and playing these older games because it gives you a snapshot of what
WWE was like at the time.</p>
